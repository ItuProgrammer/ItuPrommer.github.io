    Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in South Africa,
    with rates increasing over recent years.Here are key insights on breast 
    cancer in South Africa:

    <pre class="para2"><h2 class="heading2">  
        Malithabo ?Prevalence and Mortality:</h2>
    Breast cancer accounts for about 25% of all cancer diagnoses in South 
    African women.The incidence rate is around 43 per 100,000 women, higher 
    in urban than rural areas.Women are generally diagnosed between ages 50-55, 
    younger than in many high-income countries.High mortality rates are linked to 
    late-stage diagnoses and limited healthcare access, with around 4,000 deaths in 2020.
    </pre>

    <pre class="para4"><h2 class="heading3">  Early Detection and Screening:</h2>
    Access to mammography is limited, especially in rural areas.Public health recommends screening
    for women over 40, but few have access.Only 30% of cases are detected early,hindered by 
    low awareness and limited screening programs.
    </pre>

    <pre><h2 class="heading4">  Survival Rates:</h2>
    Late detection leads to lower survival rates, with only 20-30% surviving late-stage diagnoses 
    versus 80-90% for early detection.Black women tend to be diagnosed at later stages and have
    worse outcomes than white women, influenced by socio-economic factors.
    </pre>
    
    <pre><h2 class="heading5">  Breast Cancer in Men:</h2>
    Rare but present in about 1% of cases, with an incidence rate of 1 per 100,000 men.Male breast
    cancer is often diagnosed late due to low awareness, stigma, and ignorance of symptoms.Risk 
    factors include genetic mutations (BRCA2),family history, hormone-related conditions, and
    obesity.Survival rates are stage-dependent, with early detection offering outcomes comparable
    to womenâ€™s.
	 </pre>

   <pre><h2 class="heading6">  Awareness and Education:</h2>
    Limited awareness of male breast cancer highlights the need for inclusive education campaigns. 
    Treatment for male breast cancer mirrors that of women,involving surgery, radiation, and hormonal
    therapies.
